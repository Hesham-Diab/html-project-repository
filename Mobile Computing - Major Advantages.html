<p>Mobile computing has changed the complete landscape of our day-to-day life. Following are the major advantages of Mobile Computing −</p>
<p>major advantages of Mobile Computing −</p> 
<p style="font-size:230%">Location Flexibility</p>
<p>This has enabled users to work from anywhere as long as there is a connection established.</p>
<p> A user can work without being in a fixed position. Their mobility ensures that they are </p>
<p>able to carry out numerous tasks at the same time and perform their stated jobs.</p>
<p style="font-size:230%">Saves Time</p>

<p>The time consumed or wasted while travelling from different locations or to the office and back,</p>
<p>has been slashed. One can now access all the important documents and files over a secure channel </p>
<p>or portal and work as if they were on their computer. It has enhanced telecommuting in many companies.</p>
<p>It has also reduced unnecessary incurred expenses.</p>
<p style="font-size:230%">Enhanced Productivity</p>

<p>Users can work efficiently and effectively from whichever location they find comfortable.</p> 
<p>This in turn enhances their productivity level.</p>

<p style="font-size:230%">Ease of Research</p>

<p>Research has been made easier, since users earlier were required to go to the field and search</p>
<p>for facts and feed them back into the system. It has also made it easier for field officers and</p>
<p>researchers to collect and feed data from wherever they are without making unnecessary trips to</p>
<p>and from the office to the field.</p>

<p style="font-size:230%">Entertainment</p>

<p>Video and audio recordings can now be streamed on-the-go using mobile computing. It's easy to</p>
<p>access a wide variety of movies, educational and informative material. With the improvement and</p>
<p>availability of high speed data connections at considerable cost, one is able to get all the </p>
<p>entertainment they want as they browse the internet for streamed data. One is able to watch news,</p>
<p>movies, and documentaries among other entertainment offers over the internet. This was not possible</p>
<p>before mobile computing dawned on the computing world.</p>

<p style="font-size:230%">Streamlining of Business Processes</p>

<p>Business processes are now easily available through secured connections. Looking into security</p>
<p>issues, adequate measures have been put in place to ensure authentication and authorization of</p> 
<p>the user accessing the services.</p>

<p>Some business functions can be run over secure links and sharing of information between</p>
<p>business partners can also take place.</p>

<p>Meetings, seminars and other informative services can be conducted using video and voice conferencing.</p>
<p>Travel time and expenditure is also considerably reduced.</p>

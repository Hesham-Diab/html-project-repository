<p>Mobile computing has its fair share of security concerns as any other technology. </p>
<p>Due to its nomadic nature, it's not easy to monitor the proper usage. Users might</p>
<p>have different intentions on how to utilize this privilege. Improper and unethical</p>
<p>practices such as hacking, industrial espionage, pirating, online fraud and malicious</p>
<p>destruction are some but few of the problems experienced by mobile computing.</p>

<p>Another big problem plaguing mobile computing is credential verification.</p>
<p>As other users share username and passwords, it poses as a major threat to </p>
<p>security. This being a very sensitive issue, most companies are very reluctant</p>
<p>to implement mobile computing to the dangers of misrepresentation.</p>

<p>The problem of identity theft is very difficult to contain or eradicate.</p>
<p>Issues with unauthorized access to data and information by hackers, is</p>
<p>also an enormous problem. Outsiders gain access to steal vital data from</p>
<p>companies, which is a major hindrance in rolling out mobile computing services.</p>

<p>No company wants to lay open their secrets to hackers and other intruders,</p>
<p>who will in turn sell the valuable information to their competitors. It's </p>
<p>also important to take the necessary precautions to minimize these threats</p>
<p>from taking place. Some of those measures include −</p>

<ul>
	<li>Hiring qualified personnel.</li>
	<li>Installing security hardware and software</li>
	<li>Educating the users on proper mobile computing ethics</li>
	<li>Auditing and developing sound, effective policies to govern mobile computing</li>
	<li>Enforcing proper access rights and permissions</li>
</ul>

<p>These are just but a few ways to help deter possible threats to any company planning to offer</p>
<p>mobile computing. Since information is vital, all possible measures should be evaluated and </p>
<p>implemented for safeguard purposes.

<p>In the absence of such measures, it's possible for exploits and other unknown threats to </p>
<p>infiltrate and cause irrefutable harm. These may be in terms of reputation or financial </p>
<p>penalties. In such cases, it's very easy to be misused in different unethical practices.</p>

<p>If these factors aren’t properly worked on, it might be an avenue for constant threat.</p> 
<p>Various threats still exist in implementing this kind of technology.</p>

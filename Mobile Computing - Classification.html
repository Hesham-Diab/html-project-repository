<p>Mobile computing is not only limited to mobile phones, but there are various gadgets available in</p>
<p>the market that are built on a platform to support mobile computing. They are usually classified in</p>
<p>the following categories âˆ’</p> 
<p style="font-size:230%">Personal Digital Assistant (PDA)</p>
<p>The main purpose of this device is to act as an electronic organizer or day planner that is portable,</p>
<p>easy to use and capable of sharing information with your computer systems.</p>
<p>PDA is an extension of the PC, not a replacement. These systems are capable of sharing</p>
<p>information with a computer system through a process or service known as synchronization. Both </p>
<p>devices will access each other to check for changes or updates in the individual devices. The use</p>
<p>of infrared and Bluetooth connections enables these devices to always be synchronized.</p>

<p>With PDA devices, a user can browse the internet, listen to audio clips, watch video clips, edit</p>

<p> and modify office documents, and many more services. The device has a stylus and a touch sensitive </p>
<p>screen for input and output purposes.</p>

<p style="font-size:230%">Smartphones</p>
<p>This kind of phone combines the features of a PDA with that of a mobile phone or camera phone.</p>
<p> It has a superior edge over other kinds of mobile phones.</p>
<br></br>
<p>Smartphones have the capability to run multiple programs concurrently. These phones include </p>
<p>high-resolution touch screens, web browsers that can access and properly display standard web </p>
<p>pages rather than just mobile-optimized sites, and high-speed data access via Wi-Fi and high </p>
<p>speed cellular broadband</p>


<p>The most common mobile Operating Systems (OS) used by modern smartphones include </p>
<p>Google's Android, Apple's iOS, Nokia's Symbian, RIM's BlackBerry OS, Samsung's Bada, </p>
<p> Microsoft's Windows Phone, and embedded Linux distributions such as Maemo and MeeGo.</p> 
<p>Such operating systems can be installed on different phone models, and typically each </p>
<p>device can receive multiple OS software updates over its lifetime.</p>
